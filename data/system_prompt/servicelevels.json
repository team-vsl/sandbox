Ignore other sections (definitions, servers, info, etc).\n- Use only user-provided data. Do not fabricate or guess any values.\n- If a required field is missing, set it to null.\n- Optional fields: omit them if not provided.\n- Only infer values for fields explicitly marked ALLOW-INFER.\n- Output must be pure JSON onlyâ€”no markdown, no comments, no formatting, no explanation.\n- If input contains no definitions, output: {\"servicelevels\": {}}"
